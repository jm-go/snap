## How to Run

Ensure Java is installed on your system to play the Snap game:

1. Compile the project with your preferred development tools.
2. Run the `Main` class within the `snap` package to start the game.

## Gameplay

1. Players start by selecting a game mode: single-player or two-player.
2. In each turn, a player draws a card by pressing 'Enter'.
3. The game continues until a player wins by catching a snap or the deck runs out of cards.


## Future Enhancements

- **Unit Testing**: Implement unit tests for robust validation and future-proofing.
- **Snap Timer**: Add a 2-second timer for players to declare "snap" and intensify gameplay.
- **Score Tracking**: Create a system to track and display player scores.
